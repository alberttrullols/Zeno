Gaussian Zeno Dynamics
Frequent measurements slow the evolution of a quantum system, hindering transitions to states different from the initial one. This phenomenon, known as the quantum Zeno effect (QZE), arises from general features of the Schr√∂dinger equation, leading to quadratic behavior of the survival probability at short times. Von Neumann \cite{1} first identified the connection between short-time evolution and the Zeno effect, though his work on quantum thermodynamics went unnoticed for 35 years. Attention grew with Beskow and Nilsson's \cite{2} suggestion that frequent position measurements in a bubble chamber could prevent particle decay, supported by Khalfin \cite{3} and mathematically formalized by Friedman \cite{4}. The QZE concept was ultimately solidified by Misra and Sudarshan \cite{5}, who connected it to Zeno's paradox and blended rigorous mathematics with philosophical reflections. Theoretical until 1988, Cook \cite{6} proposed testing it with oscillating systems, leading to Itano \textit{et al.}'s \cite{7} landmark experiment. Subsequent studies verified the effect in various systems, including photon polarization, nuclear spins, ions, optical pumping, NMR, and Bose-Einstein condensates. In these implementations, the quantum system is confined to its initial state through one-dimensional projections.

Building on the quantum Zeno effect, quantum Zeno dynamics (QZD) \cite{8} extends the concept by showing that frequent measurements can allow a system to evolve within a subspace defined by the measurement process. Unlike QZE, which freezes a system in its initial state, QZD enables evolution within a multidimensional "Zeno subspace" \cite{9}. Grounded in Misra and Sudarshan's theorem \cite{5}, this phenomenon broadens the understanding of measurement and quantum evolution. Recently, QZD was observed in a rubidium condensate \cite{10}, revealing a superselection rule between two- and three-dimensional subspaces.

In this work, we investigate QZD in the infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces of position and momentum, with measurements modeled as Von Neumann projections. We first analyze the effects of frequent position measurements on a free particle, observing that, in the limit of many measurements, QZD manifests as unitary evolution confined to the Hilbert subspace defined by the Zeno subspace, subject to rigid Dirichlet boundary conditions \cite{11}. Next, motivated by the previous results, we investigate the effect of frequent momentum measurements on a particle interacting with a potential barrier exceeding its total energy. This setup causes momentum reversal classically, as the particle energy is insufficient to overcome the barrier. Similar to position measurements, the state of the particle in momentum space is confined within the Zeno subspace, resulting in intriguing dynamics analogous to those observed in position space. We explore both tunneling and non-tunneling scenarios.

We begin by establishing the foundational framework for the systems under consideration in Section II. Next, in section III, we investigate the effects of many position measurements on a free particle. Subsequently, section IV contrasts these findings with the phenomena observed when many momentum measurements are performed on a particle in a potential. Finally, section V concludes the work with a summary of the resulting dynamics.
